# Post-event surveys

## Survey Concepts

### General

- Ask 1 question at a time. For example, do not mix speaker feedback with questions about venue stage. 
- Avoid bias and complexity in question wording. Group “easy” questions up front and ask for specifics further into the survey.
- Only ask questions will impact future decisions for the event. For example in the question “Which, if any, of the following would prevent you from attending a future DevOpsDays Chicago? (Check all that apply)” we do not ask if participants would want sponsor talks because it is not something organizers would change.
- (opinion) Force participants to decide. On a scale rating (“For the sponsorship process, how satisfied were you with”) offer 5 to 7 responses so participants
- More on survey design from Pew Research, Harvard Business Review and Qualtrics

### Feedback for speakers

- Open-ended questions allow more nuanced responses, but are harder to analyze 
- Open-ended questions are more often skipped
- NEVER send survey feedback to speakers before reviewing with other organizers

### Conference survey

- Time surveys to happen very soon after the event to capture the most responses
- Past surveys split respondents into: speakers, sponsors, participants, and volunteers
- Past surveys offered $25 Amazon gift cards to respondents. Not sure if it drove participation or not.
