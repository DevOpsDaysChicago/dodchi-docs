# DevOpsDays Chicago admins group

A subset of organizers will be considered to be “admins” for access/administration of tools. Adding a member to this group requires approval from at least two existing members of the group (confirmed via email sent to admins@devopsdayschi.org).

When possible, the email address used for administration of a tool should be admins@devopsdayschi.org. This is to reduce the surface for account password changes, etc. 

Shared passwords (such as the Google Apps admin user, the Twitter account, etc) should only be known by members of the Admins group. Full administrative access to tools should be limited to members of this group. 

When a member of the Admins group leaves the devopsdays Chicago organizing team, all shared passwords must be reset.
