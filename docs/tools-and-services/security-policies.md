# Security policies

When possible, two-factor authentication should be used by all accounts. This is especially necessary for any system that allows public posting or communications (Mailchimp, social networking systems, etc), as well as any master/administrative functions (admins in Google apps, etc). **All devopsdayschi.org Google Apps accounts require two-factor authentication.**

There is no requirement to use a devopsdayschi.org email address for individual accounts accessing tools (for example, you can use your personal email address for logging into Mailchimp, Sprout Social, Trello, etc).
