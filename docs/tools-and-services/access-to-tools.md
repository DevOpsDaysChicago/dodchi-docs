# Access to tools

When providing access to the tools used by the organizing team, the principle of least privilege should be applied. Full administrative access to tools should only be provided to organizers who are in the Admins group (see below for more information about this group). As much as possible, shared logins should be avoided (for example, use of Sprout Social by individuals with their own accounts rather than sharing the @devopsdayschi Twitter password). 

An onboarding/offboarding checklist will be created that ensures all team members are granted appropriate access to tools when they join the team, and that their access is removed when they leave the organizing team.
