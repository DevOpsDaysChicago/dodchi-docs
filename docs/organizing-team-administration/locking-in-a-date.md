# Locking in a date

Once you've confirmed a date or are very close to confirming one, everything starts to move. Congrats - here comes the fun part!

You can use this [thread from 2024 planning](https://devopsdays-chi.slack.com/archives/C02E2352B/p1707758749838289) as a 
loose checklist for the cross-functional things that need to happen ASAP when a date/venue is selected.


> 1. Confirm date/venue ( @venue )
> 2. Finalize CFP dates and content (discussion in #content )
> 3. Finalize sponsorship level costs (discussion in #sponsorship ) 
> 4. PayPal Sponsor buttons generated (ConferenceOps) (once #3 is done)
> 5. Finalize ticket cost / early bird dates ( disucssion thread) 
> 6. Turn on Pretix (once #1 is done) 
> 7. Turn on Pretalx (once #1 is done) 
> 8. Update PR with CFP details (once #2 is done) 
> 9. Update PR with PayPal buttons for sponsorship (once #4 is done)
