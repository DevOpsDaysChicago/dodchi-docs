# Adding new members to the organizing team

Adding a new member to the organizing team requires a majority vote from existing organizers. If any existing organizer vetoes a proposed new member, the new member will not be invited to join. It is recommended/preferred that new members have either a) helped organize a devopsdays event in the past (either a previous DevOpsDays Chicago, or a devopsdays at a different city) or b) are a previous volunteer for a DevOpsDays Chicago event.

The proposal and voting on new members should be done via email to chicago@devopsdays.org, and not via Slack.
