### Example Welcome Email


> Hi `Person`! After reviewing with the team, we would love to invite you to join the DevOpsDays Chicago organizing team! If you are interested in doing so, please fill out this form here - `FormLink`
> 
> (that form contains a few details on expectations and gives me some info we need!)
> 
> ******************************************************
> 
> To level-set a few things about what it means to be an organizer:
> 
> - we have regular meetings, which generally take place over Zoom (although we sometimes meet in person, just to keep in touch). These meetings are currently every other Thursday at noon central time (next meeting is `NextMeetingDate` to help out with the "every other"). As the event gets closer, the meetings will become weekly. You do not need to attend every meeting, but it is expected to try to attend as many as possible. 
> - we have a dedicated Slack workspace for the organizing team. It is expected to check this Slack at least every other day M-F (if you are traveling or on PTO/vacation, this doesn't apply)
> - you will be set up with a devopsdayschi.org email address. It is expected that you will check this email at once a day M-F, and acknowledge/reply to messages sent to you there. you can, of course, forward this to another email address if you like.
> - Depending upon the committee(s) you choose to take part in, the amount of effort for being on this team will vary throughout the months leading up to the event. However, it is expected that as an organizer you will be available all-day on `EventDays` (the days of the event), and usually we also plan to work together on `DayBeforeEvent` (the day before the event). 

> Still interested? Fill out this form `FormLink` and we can go from there! Any questions you might have, please let me know!
