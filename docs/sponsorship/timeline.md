# Timeline

We cannot sell sponsorships until we have something to offer. We start to plan the sponsorship offers as soon as we have the details. Companies often require months to allocate sponsorship money, especially around budget or fiscal year end times.

1. Final, signed contract to get venue and date

2. Venue layout to plan sponsor layout and number of tables available

3. Create a prospectus

4. Draft emails and follow ups (see emails examples for timing)

5. Answer questions and update prospectus, website, emails as needed

6. As sponsors pay, share timing for follow ups (For example, shipping info will be available 6 weeks before the event)

7. As sponsorships fill up send out reminders

8. Require all final payments 4 weeks before event

9. As the event approaches notify paid sponsors of deadlines for things such as A/V, shipping, sponsor participant registration

10. Remind sponsor contacts to share information with on site teams, including outgoing shipping instructions (but plan for them not to communicate).
