# Sponsorship overview

DevOpsDays are unique events, organized by and for the local community of DevOps practitioners. Most sponsor companies have large Marketing and Sales departments and are used to working with multiple, professional corporate conferences each year. 

As a Sponsor Coordinator for DevOpsDays remind potential sponsors that our events are different and communicate as much as possible to avoid any misunderstandings. Globally DevOpsDays does not allow sponsored talks (this contradicts the overall authenticity of community) and participant contact information is never shared - see https://devopsdays.org/organizing for more. 

When seeking sponsors, remind companies that they are paying to support the event and local community. In exchange for their sponsorship they will receive the benefits explicitly outlined by your team on the website and prospectus. If in doubt, do not negotiate.
Ken Mugrage (Seattle, Core) had a great presentation on sponsor management at DevOpsDays Ghent Day0: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ethyj8tRXI3m-_jS197HJEAYdF3Dq4QVWjpwi2FFnyI/edit?usp=sharing
