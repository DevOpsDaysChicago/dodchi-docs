# Expense policy

If you have an expense related to DevOpsDays Chicago, this is the policy around approvals and reimbursements.

The email alias <expenses@devopsdayschi.org> should be used for all approvals and reimbursement requests. This email address forwards to the authorized expense approvers for DevOpsDays Chicago as well as to Laura Wickett of ConferenceOps.

## Pre-approval

If the expense is over $400, it is recommended that you obtain pre-approval from the Expense Approvers group. Send an email to <expenses@devopsdayschi.org> with information on what the expense is for, and what the estimated cost is. This is not required, but it is highly recommended to avoid issues when submitting for reimbursement. Please be clear in the email that this is a request for pre-approval, so that Laura does not think you are submitting an expense for reimbursement.

## Payment by ConferenceOps for an expense

If you do not wish to use your own personal funds/credit card for an expense, you can request that Laura from ConferenceOps arrange the payment for you. Please send the necessary information for this payment (including any invoices or other record for the amount) to <expenses@devopsdayschi.org>, and request that Laura provide the payment.. After two approvals from the expense approval team, Laura will arrange the payment.

## Reimbursement

If you have paid for an expense with your own personal funds/credit card, please send receipts to <expenses@devopsdayschi.org> for approval. After two approvals from the expense approval team, Laura will reimburse you using one of the approved reimbursement methods (Zelle Quickpay, PayPal, or a paper check mailed to you)
